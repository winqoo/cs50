1.  It is a header file that contains declarations and implementations of base functions needed in C like printf().
2.  It makes understanding of variable size easier, like uint8_t = unsigned integer of size 8 bits.
3.  
BYTE =  1
DWORD = 4
LONG = 4
WORD = 2
4.  0x42 4d
5.  bfsize - The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file. bisize - The number of bytes required by the structure.
6.  If biHeight is negative, indicating a top-down DIB, biCompression must be either BI_RGB or BI_BITFIELDS. Top-down DIBs cannot be compressed.
7. biBitCount
8.fopen() might rerutn null when it either can't open file or can't create it.
9.  Program is reading one struct at a time.
10.  2
11. it skeeps padding
12. current posiiton in file
